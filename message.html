                For You,<br><br>

                Seven years ago, I found you and without even realizing it,
                I found my home. Through every smile, every tear, every fight,
                and every silence, we chose each other again and again.<br><br>

                You’ve seen me at my weakest and believed in me at my strongest.
                With you, love has never been just a word it has been patience,
                effort, trust, and understanding.<br><br>

                Thank you for staying, for believing, and for loving me the way
                you do. I don’t just love you for who you are I love you for
                who I’ve become because of you.<br><br>

                Seven years down, a lifetime to go.
                And I would still choose you every single time. ❤️
            </p>
